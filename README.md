# literature-in-GT
Citation links for discussions of literature reviews in Grounded Theory.

## The purpose 

The use of literature in grounded theory studies has been a topic of debate for over 40 years. The Cypher script in this project can be used to quickly identify the main sources and add new ones. This will be helpful to other students and researchers by giving them a headstart on identifying the key sources.
